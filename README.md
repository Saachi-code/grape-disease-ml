## 📖 Summary
This project applies **machine learning and deep learning** to detect grapevine diseases in California, focusing on:
- Powdery Mildew  
- Downy Mildew  
- Gray Mold  
- Flower Leaf Virus  

Models trained and compared:  
- **DCNN** – baseline convolutional network (90.11% accuracy)  
- **NASNet Large** – transfer learning, achieved **100% accuracy**  
- **MobileNet V2** – lightweight, efficient, achieved **99% accuracy**  
- **AlexNet** – older architecture, struggled (~42% accuracy)  
- **YOLOv5** – object detection, **98.9% accuracy**, real-time ready
